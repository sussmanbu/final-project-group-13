### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


# More people are dying giving birth over last few decades, even with better medical equipment…?

With the educational guess of having a decreasing trend in the maternal mortality rate in the past 20 years, the original purpose of the team was to see how the healthcare policy and the economic reasons can affect the MMR in each racial group. However, with the reveal of the unexpected increasing trend in the death rate, other environmental factors are worth to explore which could possibly give reasonable explanations for the growing trend of mortality rate. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset
data_path <- "dataset/phc_mmr_combined.csv"
data <- read_csv(data_path, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Aggregate mean_val by year
national_mmr <- data %>%
  group_by(year_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_mmr = sum(mean_val, na.rm = TRUE))  # Sum across states

# Plot the trend of mean_val over the years
ggplot(national_mmr, aes(x = year_id, y = mean_mmr)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +  # Line graph
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +  # Points on line graph
  labs(title = "Trend of Mean MMR Over Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean MMR") +

### Why does the investigation on MMR matter?
The maternal mortality rate is a comprehensive dataset that gives insight into the trends and disparities of public health resources, the guiding formulation of the related policy, and the overall societal welfare. This research matters not only because it reflects the effectiveness of the healthcare system, but the increasing tendency also highlight the broader socioeconomic causes behind the scenes. 

Here is the trend of MMR and Healthcare Spending for each state from 1999 to 2019:

### Rich Girl Young Age?
In the exploration of the possible environmental factors, the scholar articles give us the idea to take a close look at the healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy. Both the datasets show the trend over time which offers us two solid facts: 1. People are having babies at an older age over time. 2. The spending on healthcare is increasing over time. We predict that the MMR will not be statistically noticeable in groups of the younger age of pregnancy and higher spending on healthcare. So, a rich girl at a young age should be a satisfying answer, but is it?

# Thesis statement
The increase in the maternal mortality rate is significantly influenced by a combination of environmental factors —- spending on healthcare, and the average age of pregnancy. 

# Thoughts form Findings 
### Younger Age is preferred, but
Though as mentioned in a lot of bio medical research, there does not seem to exist such an age range as “the golden year of giving birth”, the statistical results show that the average age of pregnancy is a strong indicator of the MMR trend. This trend supports the idea that the growing average age is contributing to the increasing maternal mortality rate across the country. Considering that fact that the MMR can also linked to the chronic disease and other maternal diseases that leads to fatal situations, it is fair to consider the probability that the increasing age of pregnancy also link to these factors.

### Spending needs a second thought…
In the analysis of healthcare spending, the data shows a moderate link between spending and maternal mortality rates (MMR). This contradicts the common sense that more money spent on healthcare would lead to better outcomes for younger mothers. There are other many other factors that can affect MMR. 


# Future Action
Despite the advanced medical technology and healthcare practices, the Maternal Mortality Rate(MMR) unexpectedly grows in the recent decades. The sharp increase of MMR in all race groups and regional groups reveal the crucial fact that the resource allocation and socioeconomic factors are drastically influencing the data performance. 

By understanding the complex potential causes, the research underscores the the need for comprehensive strategies addressing broader determinants of health, economic resources, and healthcare practices to reverse this troubling trend in maternal mortality.
