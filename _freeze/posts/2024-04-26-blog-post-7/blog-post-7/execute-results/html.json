We want to add a map of the US states with fill by MMR, with a slidey bar for changing the year. \n\nFirst we can add clear, descriptive titles and captions to your graphs to convey their purpose and provide context. Annotations and highlights are crucial for pointing out key insights or significant data points, which can be achieved using `geom_text` or `geom_label` in ggplot2, supported by `ggpubr`. For interactive elements, consider using the `plotly` or `leaflet` packages for dynamic features like a sliding bar to explore changes over time. Ensure your color choices are accessible and consistent, and utilize `ggpubr` to adjust themes, scales, and legends to make the graphs visually appealing and easy to understand.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read_csv(\"dataset/Cleaned_Pregnancy_Data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 912 Columns: 30\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): state, notes, versiondate, region\ndbl (26): year, pregnancyratelt15, pregnancyrate1517, pregnancyrate1819, pre...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naverage_data <- data %>%\n  group_by(year, region) %>%\n  summarize(MeanAge = mean(average_age_of_pregnancy, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(average_data, aes(x = year, y = MeanAge, color = region, group = region)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of Mean Age of Pregnancy Over Time by Region\",\n       x = \"year\",\n       y = \"Mean Age of Pregnancy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-7_files/figure-html/graph 1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nGraph 1:\nThis graph displays the trend of the mean age of pregnancy over time, categorized by region. From  the graph, we can figure out that:\nIn every region, the mean age of pregnancy has increased over time. This suggests that, on average, women are having children at an older age than they did in the past.\nThe 'West' region shows the highest mean age of pregnancy over the entire timeline, starting at around 24 years in the 1970s and rising to just below 30 by the 2010s.\nThe 'Midwest' and 'South' regions appear to have a similar starting point in the 1970s but diverge slightly over time. The 'South' follows closely with the 'West', but it still has a lower mean age of pregnancy by the 2010s.\nThe 'Northeast' region begins with the lowest mean age of pregnancy but increases at a rate similar to the 'Midwest', surpassing it around the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata <- read_csv(\"dataset/phc_mmr_with_age.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 1176 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): state, AverageAge, Region\ndbl (3): year, spending, mean_val\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata$spending <- as.numeric(data$spending)\ndata$AverageAge <- as.numeric(data$AverageAge)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart with Fitted Lines by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       size = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-7_files/figure-html/graph 2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Region\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$colour\n$title\n[1] \"Region\"\n\n$title.position\nNULL\n\n$title.theme\nNULL\n\n$title.hjust\nNULL\n\n$title.vjust\nNULL\n\n$label\n[1] TRUE\n\n$label.position\nNULL\n\n$label.theme\nNULL\n\n$label.hjust\nNULL\n\n$label.vjust\nNULL\n\n$keywidth\nNULL\n\n$keyheight\nNULL\n\n$direction\nNULL\n\n$override.aes\nnamed list()\n\n$nrow\nNULL\n\n$ncol\nNULL\n\n$byrow\n[1] FALSE\n\n$reverse\n[1] FALSE\n\n$order\n[1] 0\n\n$available_aes\n[1] \"any\"\n\n$name\n[1] \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guide\"  \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guides\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Print the plot\nprint(ggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Healthcare Spending vs. Average Age of Pregnancy by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\nRemoved 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-7_files/figure-html/graph 2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGraph 2:\nThis scatter plot compares healthcare spending with the average age of pregnancy by region. Key observations include:\nThere appears to be a positive correlation between healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy in all regions. This implies that as healthcare spending increases, the average age of pregnancy tends to be higher.\nThe data for the 'West' region, shown in purple, indicates a particularly strong positive correlation, suggesting that increased healthcare spending in this region might be closely associated with women having children at older ages.\nOverall, the graph suggests a trend where regions with higher healthcare spending are associated with older average ages of pregnancy, which could reflect a variety of factors such as access to reproductive health services, birth control, career opportunities, or other socioeconomic factors that allow or encourage women to delay pregnancy.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = AverageAge, y = mean_val, size = spending)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~Region) +\n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart of Average Age, MMR, and Healthcare Spending\",\n       x = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       y = \"MMR (per 100,000 live births)\",\n       size = \"Healthcare Spending\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-7_files/figure-html/graph 3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGraph 3:\nThis bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the average age of pregnancy, maternal mortality ratio (MMR per 100,000 live births), and healthcare spending by region. The x-axis represents the average age of pregnancy, the y-axis represents the MMR, and the bubble size corresponds to healthcare spending, with larger bubbles indicating higher spending.\n\nObservations from the chart:\n- There appears to be a concentration of data points between the ages of 24 and 30, with varying MMR across the regions.\n- The Midwest, Northeast, and South regions have clusters with a wide range of MMR values but are generally centered around the same average age of pregnancy.\n- The West region shows a cluster with a lower MMR in comparison to other regions for a similar average age of pregnancy.\n\nThe chart suggests complexity in the relationship between healthcare spending, the average age of pregnancy, and MMR, and it would likely require a deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors and dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggmap)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nℹ Google's Terms of Service: <https://mapsplatform.google.com>\n  Stadia Maps' Terms of Service: <https://stadiamaps.com/terms-of-service/>\n  OpenStreetMap's Tile Usage Policy: <https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/>\nℹ Please cite ggmap if you use it!
