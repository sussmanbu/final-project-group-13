Limitations may include incomplete data due to underreporting, differences in data collection methods between states or agencies, and challenges in capturing the complexity of racial and ethnic identity in a standardized manner. Transparency of these limits is essential to prevent misuse of data, such as oversimplified narratives that may mask the underlying causes of disparities in maternal mortality. \n\n### Beneficence\nGood dataset require maximization of benefits and minimization of harm. For maternal mortality data, this means ensuring that data is collected, analysed and disseminated without prejudice to the communities represented, and that survey results are used equitably to improve maternal health outcomes. To uphold this principle, one limitation of practicing philanthropy may be the challenge of balancing the need for detailed data to identify differences with the risk of stigmatizing specific communities. \n\n### Justice\nJustice involves a fair distribution of benefits and burdens. These limitations can be structural barriers to the equitable implementation of interventions, such as systemic racism in the health care system and socioeconomic inequalities that affect health outcomes.\n\n\n### Initial Data Exploration\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nload(\"dataset/mmr.RData\")\n\nmmr_data_clean |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = val)) + \n    geom_histogram() + \n    xlim(0, 200)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
