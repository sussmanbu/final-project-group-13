    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nOur exploratory data contains detailed data on personal healthcare spending on a per capita basis by state and by service from 1991 to 2020. Here are some ideas related to maternal mortality ratio based on this information:\n\nBy examining the trend of per capita spending across years, one could identify which states have seen the most significant increases or decreases in spending and how the distribution of spending across services has changed.\nRelation to Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR):\n\n\nAccess to Care: Correlating per capita spending with MMR could reveal if higher spending correlates with lower maternal mortality rates, suggesting that access to care might be a significant factor.\nFunding for Maternal Health: Evaluating whether specific funding (like Medicaid expansions) is associated with improvements in maternal outcomes.\nRate Idea: Efficiency of Spending: Analyzing if increased spending in certain healthcare services (such as prenatal and postnatal care) is more effective in reducing MMR compared to others.\n\nThe rating of these ideas would depend on a detailed analysis of the CSV data against reliable maternal mortality statistics. One would need to perform statistical analysis, like regression models, to identify significant predictors of maternal mortality and to determine the strength of the relationship between healthcare spending and maternal health outcomes.\n\n\nThesis\nFirst of all, according to our regression graph of MMR vs. Health Care Spending by Years.As the government spending on Health Care increase, the MMR decrease.\n\n\nVisulization\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nload(here::here(\"dataset/phc_mmr.RData\"))\n\ncombined_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = spending, y = mean_val)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.01))+  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maternal Mortality v.s. Healthcare Spending\",\n    x = \"Spending\",\n    y = \"MMR\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAn initial plot of personal healthcare spending versus maternal mortality ratio shows a roughly positive correlation between the two variables which contradicts what we expected the relationship to be coming into this analysis. We would have expected a negative correlation, implying that as states spend more on healthcare overall, maternal mortality rates would be lower.\n\ncombined_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = spending, y = mean_val)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.01)) + \n  facet_wrap(~year_id) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maternal Mortality v.s. Healthcare Spending by Year\",\n    x = \"Spending\",\n    y = \"MMR\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWe then faceted the initial graph by year to show the trend over time. This reveals a few things. Firstly, when faceted by year the relationship no longer appears to have a positive correlation. The trend is hard to see without a regression however it does appear to be negatively correlated now. Additionally, the points for each state are spreading out. In the first few years, all the points are clumped together with lower values. However, as the years go by the points not only overall increase in value but move farther apart. This prompted us to do a standard deviation analysis to quantify this observed trend.\n\nstd_dev_mmr &lt;- combined_data |&gt; \n  group_by(year_id) |&gt; \n  summarise(sd_mmr = sd(mean_val))\nstd_dev_phc &lt;- combined_data |&gt; \n  group_by(year_id) |&gt; \n  summarise(sd_phc = sd(spending))\nstd_combined &lt;- merge(std_dev_mmr, std_dev_phc, by = c(\"year_id\"), all = TRUE)\n\nFirst we calculated the standard deviation for both MMR and PHC spending grouped by year. We the plotted the standard deviations against time to see the trend.\n\nstd_combined |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=year_id, y=sd_mmr)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -25, hjust = 1), legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Standard Deviation of Maternal Mortality Ratios Over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"MMR\")\n\n\n\nstd_combined |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=year_id, y=sd_phc)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -25, hjust = 1), legend.position = \"none\") + \n    labs(\n    title = \"Standard Deviation of Healthcare Spending Over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Spending\")\n\n\n\n\nBoth graphs show an increasing trend over time, supporting an initial visual analysis that the data is getting more spread out. The graph of healthcare spending deviation is particularly linear which drew our interest however we are unsure of how this would implicate our analysis."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

The file we chose initially has columns measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. It has 5901 observations. This odd number indicates that there may be some missing observations for certain location/race/year combinations. To load the data, we made an account and downloaded the .csv file called IHME_USA_MMR_STATE_RACE_ETHN_1999_2019_ESTIMATES_Y2023M07D03. We then read it into a dataframe in R. Since the data is already very clean, we simply selected the columns location_id, location_name, race_group, year_id, val, lower, upper to keep in our cleaned dataset and discarded the rest. We chose to discard those columns because every observation had the same value. For example, every observation was Female in the age group 10 to 54. We then saved this cleaned dataframe as a .Rdata file in our repository."

Annotations and highlights are crucial for pointing out key insights or significant data points, which can be achieved using geom_text or geom_label in ggplot2, supported by ggpubr.

From the graph, we can figure out that: In every region, the mean age of pregnancy has increased over time. This suggests that, on average, women are having children at an older age than they did in the past. The ‘West’ region shows the highest mean age of pregnancy over the entire timeline, starting at around 24 years in the 1970s and rising to just below 30 by the 2010s. The ‘Midwest’ and ‘South’ regions appear to have a similar starting point in the 1970s but diverge slightly over time. The ‘South’ follows closely with the ‘West’, but it still has a lower mean age of pregnancy by the 2010s. The ‘Northeast’ region begins with the lowest mean age of pregnancy but increases at a rate similar to the ‘Midwest’, surpassing it around the mid-2000s.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"dataset/phc_mmr_with_age.csv\")\n\nRows: 1176 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): state, AverageAge, Region\ndbl (3): year, spending, mean_val\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndata$spending &lt;- as.numeric(data$spending)\ndata$AverageAge &lt;- as.numeric(data$AverageAge)\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart with Fitted Lines by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       size = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Region\"))\n\n$colour\n$title\n[1] \"Region\"\n\n$title.position\nNULL\n\n$title.theme\nNULL\n\n$title.hjust\nNULL\n\n$title.vjust\nNULL\n\n$label\n[1] TRUE\n\n$label.position\nNULL\n\n$label.theme\nNULL\n\n$label.hjust\nNULL\n\n$label.vjust\nNULL\n\n$keywidth\nNULL\n\n$keyheight\nNULL\n\n$direction\nNULL\n\n$override.aes\nnamed list()\n\n$nrow\nNULL\n\n$ncol\nNULL\n\n$byrow\n[1] FALSE\n\n$reverse\n[1] FALSE\n\n$order\n[1] 0\n\n$available_aes\n[1] \"any\"\n\n$name\n[1] \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guide\"  \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guides\"\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(ggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Healthcare Spending vs. Average Age of Pregnancy by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)) \n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\nRemoved 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph 2: This scatter plot compares healthcare spending with the average age of pregnancy by region. Key observations include: There appears to be a positive correlation between healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy in all regions. This implies that as healthcare spending increases, the average age of pregnancy tends to be higher. The data for the ‘West’ region, shown in purple, indicates a particularly strong positive correlation, suggesting that increased healthcare spending in this region might be closely associated with women having children at older ages. Overall, the graph suggests a trend where regions with higher healthcare spending are associated with older average ages of pregnancy, which could reflect a variety of factors such as access to reproductive health services, birth control, career opportunities, or other socioeconomic factors that allow or encourage women to delay pregnancy.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = AverageAge, y = mean_val, size = spending)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~Region) +\n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart of Average Age, MMR, and Healthcare Spending\",\n       x = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       y = \"MMR (per 100,000 live births)\",\n       size = \"Healthcare Spending\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph 3: This bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the average age of pregnancy, maternal mortality ratio (MMR per 100,000 live births), and healthcare spending by region. The x-axis represents the average age of pregnancy, the y-axis represents the MMR, and the bubble size corresponds to healthcare spending, with larger bubbles indicating higher spending.\nObservations from the chart: - There appears to be a concentration of data points between the ages of 24 and 30, with varying MMR across the regions. - The Midwest, Northeast, and South regions have clusters with a wide range of MMR values but are generally centered around the same average age of pregnancy. - The West region shows a cluster with a lower MMR in comparison to other regions for a similar average age of pregnancy.\nThe chart suggests complexity in the relationship between healthcare spending, the average age of pregnancy, and MMR, and it would likely require a deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors and dynamics.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggmap)\n\nℹ Google's Terms of Service: &lt;https://mapsplatform.google.com&gt;\n  Stadia Maps' Terms of Service: &lt;https://stadiamaps.com/terms-of-service/&gt;\n  OpenStreetMap's Tile Usage Policy: &lt;https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/&gt;\nℹ Please cite ggmap if you use it!

The combination of correlation analysis and regression analysis can clarify the relationship and influence of time and demographic categories on average estimates. Principal component analysis (PCA) or multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be performed to simplify data complexity and reveal inherent patterns in low-dimensional Spaces. Clustering can classify similar entities, while time series analysis can highlight time trends and make future predictions. Meanwhile, geospatial analysis can provide insight into regional differences, while sensitivity analysis can assess the reliability of average estimates within their confidence intervals.\nIn addition to these quantitative techniques, we also consider data enrichment strategies including: introducing external socioeconomic variables to deepen the contextual understanding of the estimates.

This set of data contains multiple spreadsheets, however I will focus on the most detailed one. It presents maternal mortality ratios for women in the United States from the ages 10-54 for the years 1999-2019. It divides the data into each state with a national observation, as well as separating into five racial categories. The thirteen columns right as it is downloaded are measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. Some of the columns have the same value for every observation in its raw form and will likely not be relevant to our analysis, like measure_id, measure_name, and age_group_id. Columns like location_name (the name of the state), race_group (the race of the individual), year (the year of the observation), and val (the maternal mortality ratio) will likely be most relevant to our analysis. There are 5901 rows of observations in the data set. The data set is very accessible, simply requiring an account to download. It comes in CSV form. It is quite clean already, however, pivoting the data or making subtables would likely aid in our analysis given its current organization. Some questions we can look at with this data are: “How does maternal mortality change over time? How does maternal mortality vary across US states? How does maternal mortality vary across ethnic groups?” At a deeper level, we could investigate how maternal mortality varies across both state and race groups, and compare with additional data about healthcare for different racial groups to add on a new data set. A possible challenge comes in interpreting the value for the maternal mortality ratio. The value is given along with a lower and upper value, however it is not clear how this number should be interpreted for the analysis. More research is needed here."

The government wants to collect this data to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness. This particular data focuses on the mental health situation during the pandemic. The survey was originally conducted by an internet questionnaire and the sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. The columns of the data include Indicator, group, state, subgroups, phases of treatment, time period of treatment, in which the subgroups label specifies the race, age, and gender of the individuals. The dataset rows first divide the survey takers into separate groups according to the types of treatment and mental health counseling done during the pandemic season.\nThis data is pretty accessible in CSV form. It’s a bit messy with separate subgroups under the column indicator which refer to different types and level of mental health treatment. The main problem that comes across during the data cleaning process is to reevaluate the existing group and split the groups by race, county, and state. I do think the different criteria and the design of the questionnaire make the results messy and less ideal. Some questions we can look at with this data set are: Is there a racial difference across the States of mental health treatment performance during the pandemic? Which part of America is recorded to be the biggest state of mental health care during the quarantine period? A possible challenge we might face is to find a way to filter the data and regenerate an ideal form if data where the subgroups are divided in a logical way."

Each data row indicates a person, with all characteristics numerically coded.

What is the relationship between the ICTWAGE and race, does sex affect it? 2. Do you think PERWT will affect the outcome of question 1? 3. Which race increase their income most as they getting older. The challenges we have maybe hard to graph with multi variables such as age. We need to group them in a specific range first and then graph them. In addition, the missing value may affect the outcomes. What’s more, as we have 9 millions data, we are not sure it will need more time to process the data. We may need to filter out some of the useless data."

    "text": "QQ and residual\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals vs. fitted plot of the log-log regression model shows a more random and consistent distribution of residuals compared to the previous model, indicating a better fit to the data. The spread of residuals is more uniform, suggesting that the log-log model effectively addresses non-linearity and reduces heteroscedasticity, making the variance of residuals more constant. Additionally, there are fewer extreme outliers, which means that the log-log transformation mitigates the influence of extreme data points and provides a more accurate representation of the relationship between maternal mortality rates, age, spending, and regional factors. Despite this improvement, further refinement could enhance the model’s overall fit and predictive accuracy.\n\n# QQ plot\nqqnorm(resid(log_mlr_model))\nqqline(resid(log_mlr_model), col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThe current normal Q-Q plot shows that the residuals from the log-log regression model generally follow a normal distribution, with most points aligning closely to the diagonal reference line. However, there are slight deviations at the extremes, which are indicative of some outliers affecting the tails. Compared to the previous Q-Q plot, which exhibited more extreme deviations from normality at the upper end, the log-log model demonstrates improved normality of residuals, suggesting that the log transformation helps to mitigate the influence of outliers and enhances the overall fit. Nonetheless, the presence of outliers in both models indicates potential factors influencing the data that are not fully captured in either model."

This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\nMore people are dying giving birth over last few decades, even with better medical equipment…?\nWith the educational guess of having a decreasing trend in the maternal mortality rate in the past 20 years, the original purpose of the team was to see how the healthcare policy and the economic reasons can affect the MMR in each racial group. However, with the reveal of the unexpected increasing trend in the death rate, other environmental factors are worth to explore which could possibly give reasonable explanations for the growing trend of mortality rate.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the investigation on MMR matter?\nThe maternal mortality rate is a comprehensive dataset that gives insight into the trends and disparities of public health resources, the guiding formulation of the related policy, and the overall societal welfare. This research matters not only because it reflects the effectiveness of the healthcare system, but the increasing tendency also highlight the broader socioeconomic causes behind the scenes.\nHere is the trend of MMR and Healthcare Spending for each state from 1999 to 2019: Maternal Mortality Map Health Care Spending Map\n\n\nRich Girl Young Age?\nIn the exploration of the possible environmental factors, the scholar articles give us the idea to take a close look at the healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy. Both the datasets show the trend over time which offers us two solid facts: 1. People are having babies at an older age over time. 2. The spending on healthcare is increasing over time. We predict that the MMR will not be statistically noticeable in groups of the younger age of pregnancy and higher spending on healthcare. So, a rich girl at a young age should be a satisfying answer, but is it?\n\n\n\nThesis statement\nThe increase in the maternal mortality rate is significantly influenced by a combination of environmental factors —- spending on healthcare, and the average age of pregnancy.\n\n\nThoughts form Findings\n\nYounger Age is preferred, but\nThough as mentioned in a lot of bio medical research, there does not seem to exist such an age range as “the golden year of giving birth”, the statistical results show that the average age of pregnancy is a strong indicator of the MMR trend. This trend supports the idea that the growing average age is contributing to the increasing maternal mortality rate across the country. Considering that fact that the MMR can also linked to the chronic disease and other maternal diseases that leads to fatal situations, it is fair to consider the probability that the increasing age of pregnancy also link to these factors.\nHere are two links to relevant bio-medical research:\n\nArticle on Causes of Maternal Mortality in the United States\nArticle on Disease duing Pregancy\n\n\n\nSpending needs a second thought…\nIn the analysis of healthcare spending, the data shows a moderate link between spending and maternal mortality rates (MMR). This contradicts the common sense that more money spent on healthcare would lead to better outcomes for younger mothers. There are other many other factors that can affect MMR.\n\n\n\nFuture Action\nDespite the advanced medical technology and healthcare practices, the Maternal Mortality Rate(MMR) unexpectedly grows in the recent decades. The sharp increase of MMR in all race groups and regional groups reveal the crucial fact that the resource allocation and socioeconomic factors are drastically influencing the data performance.\nBy understanding the complex potential causes, the research underscores the the need for comprehensive strategies addressing broader determinants of health, economic resources, and healthcare practices to reverse this troubling trend in maternal mortality."

This suggests that in most regions, the average age at which women are pregnant falls within this bracket. The histogram also shows that as the average age of pregnancy increases, fewer regions report these higher ages, with the 27 to 29 age range being less common and below 25 being the least common. This data can be valuable for designing region-specific healthcare policies and programs that address the reproductive health needs of women according to their predominant age groups."
