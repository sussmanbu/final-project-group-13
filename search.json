    "text": "Data Background\nThis data comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is supported by the Global Health Data Exchange. It presents maternal mortality ratios for women in the United States from the ages 10-54 for the years 1999-2019.\nSource: https://doi.org/10.6069/35ZC-FM02\nThere was no clear information on the original way of collecting the data, but from the organization, it can be inferred that the data could be mostly from medical records across the country. The original guidebook directs to: https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-maternal-mortality-by-state-race-ethnicity-1999-2019#:~:text=Data%20Release%20Information%20Sheet\nThe dataset includes MMR (maternal mortality ratio) estimates for Hispanic and any race; non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native; non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander; non-Hispanic Black; and non-Hispanic White females ages 10-54 for each year from 1999 through 2019.\nAlthough the data is quite accessible, however, pivoting the data or making subtables would likely aid in our analysis given its current organization. Some questions we can look at with this data are: “How does maternal mortality change over time? How does maternal mortality vary across US states? How does maternal mortality vary across ethnic groups?” At a deeper level, we could investigate how maternal mortality varies across both state and race groups, and compare with additional data about healthcare for different racial groups to add on a new data set. A possible challenge comes in interpreting the value for the maternal mortality ratio.\nThe data is often used to help in understanding the disparities in maternal health outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups. There are some publications related to this data already and they both highlight the points out the fact that maternal mortality rates are highest for the black population and the large increase trend across all groups especially in American India. One constantly asked question is how the huge increase in maternal mortality rate has happened with the development of medical technology over the past 20 years.\n\n\nData Loading and Cleaning\nData Loading and Cleaning Script\nThe file we chose initially has columns measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. It has 5901 observations. This odd number indicates that there may be some missing observations for certain location/race/year combinations. To load the data, we made an account and downloaded the .csv file called IHME_USA_MMR_STATE_RACE_ETHN_1999_2019_ESTIMATES_Y2023M07D03. We then read it into a dataframe in R. Since the data is already very clean, we simply selected the columns location_id, location_name, race_group, year_id, val, lower, upper to keep in our cleaned dataset and discarded the rest. We chose to discard those columns because every observation had the same value. For example, every observation was Female in the age group 10 to 54. We then saved this cleaned dataframe as a .Rdata file in our repository.\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\nvariable_info &lt;- data.frame(\n  Variable = c(\"location_id\", \"location_name\", \"race_group\", \"year_id\", \"val\", \"lower\", \"upper\"),\n  Data_Types = c(\"number\", \"text\", \"text\", \"number\", \"number\", \"number\", \"number\"),\n  Description = c(\n    \"A unique numeric identifier for the location generated and stored in an IHME database of data dimensions.\",\n    \"The location for the estimate.\",\n    \"The racial and ethnic group for the estimate.\",\n    \"The time period for the estimate.\",\n    \"Mean estimate.\",\n    \"97.5% percentile estimate.\",\n    \"2.5% percentile estimate.\"\n  ),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nprint(variable_info)\n\n       Variable Data_Types\n1   location_id     number\n2 location_name       text\n3    race_group       text\n4       year_id     number\n5           val     number\n6         lower     number\n7         upper     number\n                                                                                                Description\n1 A unique numeric identifier for the location generated and stored in an IHME database of data dimensions.\n2                                                                            The location for the estimate.\n3                                                             The racial and ethnic group for the estimate.\n4                                                                         The time period for the estimate.\n5                                                                                            Mean estimate.\n6                                                                                97.5% percentile estimate.\n7                                                                                 2.5% percentile estimate.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nload(\"dataset/mmr.RData\")\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = val)) + \n    geom_histogram() + \n    xlim(0, 200)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

From the histogram, we observe that the data is right-skewed, meaning that the majority of the data points fall on the lower end of the value range, and there are fewer observations as the value increases. This is indicated by the high bars on the left and the bars gradually decreasing in height as we move to the right, showing that high values are less common.\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year_id, race_group) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean = mean(val)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = mean)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = race_group))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year_id'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The line graph presented displays the trends of mean MMR across different racial and ethnic groups over a span of approximately two decades, starting from the year 2000. Each colored line on the graph represents a different racial or ethnic category, plotting the mean of ‘val’ for that group against the timeline of ‘year_id’. Several key trends and patterns can be discerned from the graph: - The ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ group exhibits a notable upward trajectory, suggesting a consistent increase in the mean of ‘val’ over the years. Starting from a position close to other groups in the year 2000, there is a significant rise around the year 2010, and by 2020, this group has the highest mean value among all groups shown. - ‘All racial and ethnic groups’ combined show a gradual increase, hinting at an overall rising trend in the mean of ‘val’ across the population. - The ‘Non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander’ group shows an increase, albeit with some fluctuations and a less steep incline compared to the ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ and ‘Non-Hispanic White’ groups.\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year_id, location_name) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(location_name, \"Census\")) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean = mean(val)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = mean)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = location_name))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year_id'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The line graph displayed appears to represent the trends in the mean value of MMR over time across four different U.S. Census regions: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West, from the year 2000 to just before 2020. All regions show an initial increase in the mean value from 2000, with varying rates and fluctuations. Around 2005 to 2008, the Northeast region displays a sharper increase, while the Midwest shows a more gradual rise. Post-2010, all regions experience a significant increase in mean values, with the West and South regions peaking around 2015. The Northeast region exhibits a pronounced peak shortly after 2015, followed by a decline, indicating a possible reversal of the trend or a response to an event or policy change. The trends suggest regional variations in the variable measured, with each region experiencing unique patterns of change over the two decades.\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year_id, location_name, race_group) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(location_name, \"Census\")) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean = mean(val))|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = mean)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = location_name)) + \n  facet_wrap(~race_group)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year_id', 'location_name'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The five graphs depict the trajectory of maternal mortality rates over a 20-year period, differentiated by racial categories and geographic regions in the United States. These categories include Hispanic and any race, Non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Non-Hispanic Black, and Non-Hispanic White. While there is an overarching increase in mortality rates across these racial demographics, the patterns of increase vary notably between them.\nFor the categories of Hispanic and any race, Non-Hispanic Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Non-Hispanic White, the mortality rates appear to be relatively stable, with slight fluctuations over the two decades. The lines on the graph for these groups are relatively flat, suggesting less volatility in their yearly rates and possibly better outcomes when compared to the other categories.\nContrastingly, the Non-Hispanic Black category exhibits a pronounced upward trend in the Northeast and South regions, indicating a concerning rise in maternal mortality rates that surpasses the other racial groups in these areas. This suggests that Non-Hispanic Black women in these regions are disproportionately affected by factors contributing to maternal mortality.\nThe Non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native category demonstrates a significant increase in maternal mortality rates, particularly in the Midwest and West regions. The sharp rise could be indicative of systemic health disparities or regional deficiencies in healthcare access or quality that particularly impact this demographic.\nThe observed regional differences, such as higher rates in the South and variations in the Midwest and West, might be influenced by a multitude of factors including healthcare infrastructure, socioeconomic status, accessibility of prenatal and postnatal care, and population density. Regions with higher population densities might face different healthcare challenges than less densely populated areas, potentially affecting the availability and quality of care."

    "text": "To uncover the complex interactions between variables “location_id”, “location_name”, “race_group”, “year_id”, “val”, “lower”, and “upper”, we have adopted a multi-step analysis approach. The combination of correlation analysis and regression analysis can clarify the relationship and influence of time and demographic categories on average estimates. Principal component analysis (PCA) or multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be performed to simplify data complexity and reveal inherent patterns in low-dimensional Spaces. Clustering can classify similar entities, while time series analysis can highlight time trends and make future predictions. Meanwhile, geospatial analysis can provide insight into regional differences, while sensitivity analysis can assess the reliability of average estimates within their confidence intervals.\nIn addition to these quantitative techniques, we also consider data enrichment strategies including: introducing external socioeconomic variables to deepen the contextual understanding of the estimates.

The purpose of creating and collecting this dataset was to provide insights into maternal mortality trends within the United States, focusing on the disparities among different racial and ethnic groups. This effort aligns with the broader objectives of improving maternal health outcomes and addressing health disparities. As for accessing the original source of the data, there is a “Data input source list” included in the release files which could be part of the original source providing raw materials.\n\n\n\nThis data is likely to rely on multiple sources including vital statistics systems, death certificates and also medical records. The discrepancies in reporting across the states and areas may introduce bias to the final dataset. The sample population for this dataset consists of maternal deaths occurring in the United States from 1999 to 2019. However, certain groups such as racial or ethnic minorities could be disproportionately affected by maternal mortality, but less likely to get high-quality healthcare. This situation might not be reflected directly in the final dataset.\n\n\n\nThere are other researchers used this data to analyze the questions of the mortality rate across different ethnicity groups in Trends in state-level maternal mortality by racial and ethnic group in the United States (2023). Their question is: How does maternal mortality vary by state and race and ethnicity over time in the US?\nThere are a couple of policies in the US about maternal mortality rate such as: 1. The Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) at the state level, which analyze maternal death cases and provide recommendations. 2. The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which supports states in establishing and expanding MMRCs. 3. State-specific initiatives like California’s Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, which develops strategies to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. 4. Federal funding for rural maternal health initiatives and research on maternal health disparities. Maybe some of them would use this data.\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2806661]"

This effort aligns with the broader objectives of improving maternal health outcomes and addressing health disparities. As for accessing the original source of the data, there is a “Data input source list” included in the release files which could be part of the original source providing raw materials.\n\n\n\nThis data is likely to rely on multiple sources including vital statistics systems, death certificates and also medical records. The discrepancies in reporting across the states and areas may introduce bias to the final dataset. The sample population for this dataset consists of maternal deaths occurring in the United States from 1999 to 2019. However, certain groups such as racial or ethnic minorities could be disproportionately affected by maternal mortality, but less likely to get high-quality healthcare. This situation might not be reflected directly in the final dataset.\n\n\n\nThere are other researchers used this data to analyze the questions of the mortality rate across different ethnicity groups in Trends in state-level maternal mortality by racial and ethnic group in the United States (2023). Their question is: How does maternal mortality vary by state and race and ethnicity over time in the US?\nThere are a couple of policies in the US about maternal mortality rate such as: 1. The Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) at the state level, which analyze maternal death cases and provide recommendations. 2. The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which supports states in establishing and expanding MMRCs. 3. State-specific initiatives like California’s Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, which develops strategies to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. 4. Federal funding for rural maternal health initiatives and research on maternal health disparities. Maybe some of them would use this data.\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2806661]"

    "text": "Data Loading and Cleaning\nThe data comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is supported by the Global Health Data Exchange. The file we chose initially has columns measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. It has 5901 observations. This odd number indicates that there may be some missing observations for certain location/race/year combinations. To load the data, we made an account and downloaded the .csv file called IHME_USA_MMR_STATE_RACE_ETHN_1999_2019_ESTIMATES_Y2023M07D03. We then read it into a dataframe in R. Since the data is already very clean, we simply selected the columns location_id, location_name, race_group, year_id, val, lower, upper to keep in our cleaned dataset and discarded the rest. We chose to discard those columns because every observation had the same value. For example, every observation was Female in the age group 10 to 54. We then saved this cleaned dataframe as a .Rdata file in our repository."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

This set of data contains multiple spreadsheets, however I will focus on the most detailed one. It presents maternal mortality ratios for women in the United States from the ages 10-54 for the years 1999-2019. It divides the data into each state with a national observation, as well as separating into five racial categories. The thirteen columns right as it is downloaded are measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. Some of the columns have the same value for every observation in its raw form and will likely not be relevant to our analysis, like measure_id, measure_name, and age_group_id. Columns like location_name (the name of the state), race_group (the race of the individual), year (the year of the observation), and val (the maternal mortality ratio) will likely be most relevant to our analysis. There are 5901 rows of observations in the data set. The data set is very accessible, simply requiring an account to download. It comes in CSV form. It is quite clean already, however, pivoting the data or making subtables would likely aid in our analysis given its current organization. Some questions we can look at with this data are: “How does maternal mortality change over time? How does maternal mortality vary across US states? How does maternal mortality vary across ethnic groups?” At a deeper level, we could investigate how maternal mortality varies across both state and race groups, and compare with additional data about healthcare for different racial groups to add on a new data set. A possible challenge comes in interpreting the value for the maternal mortality ratio. The value is given along with a lower and upper value, however it is not clear how this number should be interpreted for the analysis. More research is needed here."

The government wants to collect this data to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness. This particular data focuses on the mental health situation during the pandemic. The survey was originally conducted by an internet questionnaire and the sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. The columns of the data include Indicator, group, state, subgroups, phases of treatment, time period of treatment, in which the subgroups label specifies the race, age, and gender of the individuals. The dataset rows first divide the survey takers into separate groups according to the types of treatment and mental health counseling done during the pandemic season.\nThis data is pretty accessible in CSV form. It’s a bit messy with separate subgroups under the column indicator which refer to different types and level of mental health treatment. The main problem that comes across during the data cleaning process is to reevaluate the existing group and split the groups by race, county, and state. I do think the different criteria and the design of the questionnaire make the results messy and less ideal. Some questions we can look at with this data set are: Is there a racial difference across the States of mental health treatment performance during the pandemic? Which part of America is recorded to be the biggest state of mental health care during the quarantine period? A possible challenge we might face is to find a way to filter the data and regenerate an ideal form if data where the subgroups are divided in a logical way."

Each data row indicates a person, with all characteristics numerically coded.

What is the relationship between the ICTWAGE and race, does sex affect it? 2. Do you think PERWT will affect the outcome of question 1? 3. Which race increase their income most as they getting older. The challenges we have maybe hard to graph with multi variables such as age. We need to group them in a specific range first and then graph them. In addition, the missing value may affect the outcomes. What’s more, as we have 9 millions data, we are not sure it will need more time to process the data.

Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this pge should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn’t assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations."

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor’s approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture? Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\nMake a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
