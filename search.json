    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nOur exploratory data contains detailed data on personal healthcare spending on a per capita basis by state and by service from 1991 to 2020. Here are some ideas related to maternal mortality ratio based on this information:\n\nBy examining the trend of per capita spending across years, one could identify which states have seen the most significant increases or decreases in spending and how the distribution of spending across services has changed.\nRelation to Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR):\n\n\nAccess to Care: Correlating per capita spending with MMR could reveal if higher spending correlates with lower maternal mortality rates, suggesting that access to care might be a significant factor.\nFunding for Maternal Health: Evaluating whether specific funding (like Medicaid expansions) is associated with improvements in maternal outcomes.\nRate Idea: Efficiency of Spending: Analyzing if increased spending in certain healthcare services (such as prenatal and postnatal care) is more effective in reducing MMR compared to others.\n\nThe rating of these ideas would depend on a detailed analysis of the CSV data against reliable maternal mortality statistics. One would need to perform statistical analysis, like regression models, to identify significant predictors of maternal mortality and to determine the strength of the relationship between healthcare spending and maternal health outcomes.\n\n\nThesis\nFirst of all, according to our regression graph of MMR vs. Health Care Spending by Years.As the government spending on Health Care increase, the MMR decrease.\n\n\nVisulization\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nload(here::here(\"dataset/phc_mmr.RData\"))\n\ncombined_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = spending, y = mean_val)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.01))+  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maternal Mortality v.s. Healthcare Spending\",\n    x = \"Spending\",\n    y = \"MMR\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAn initial plot of personal healthcare spending versus maternal mortality ratio shows a roughly positive correlation between the two variables which contradicts what we expected the relationship to be coming into this analysis. We would have expected a negative correlation, implying that as states spend more on healthcare overall, maternal mortality rates would be lower.\n\ncombined_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = spending, y = mean_val)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.01)) + \n  facet_wrap(~year_id) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Maternal Mortality v.s. Healthcare Spending by Year\",\n    x = \"Spending\",\n    y = \"MMR\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWe then faceted the initial graph by year to show the trend over time. This reveals a few things. Firstly, when faceted by year the relationship no longer appears to have a positive correlation. The trend is hard to see without a regression however it does appear to be negatively correlated now. Additionally, the points for each state are spreading out. In the first few years, all the points are clumped together with lower values. However, as the years go by the points not only overall increase in value but move farther apart. This prompted us to do a standard deviation analysis to quantify this observed trend.\n\nstd_dev_mmr &lt;- combined_data |&gt; \n  group_by(year_id) |&gt; \n  summarise(sd_mmr = sd(mean_val))\nstd_dev_phc &lt;- combined_data |&gt; \n  group_by(year_id) |&gt; \n  summarise(sd_phc = sd(spending))\nstd_combined &lt;- merge(std_dev_mmr, std_dev_phc, by = c(\"year_id\"), all = TRUE)\n\nFirst we calculated the standard deviation for both MMR and PHC spending grouped by year. We the plotted the standard deviations against time to see the trend.\n\nstd_combined |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=year_id, y=sd_mmr)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -25, hjust = 1), legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Standard Deviation of Maternal Mortality Ratios Over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"MMR\")\n\n\n\nstd_combined |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=year_id, y=sd_phc)) + \n  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -25, hjust = 1), legend.position = \"none\") + \n    labs(\n    title = \"Standard Deviation of Healthcare Spending Over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Spending\")\n\n\n\n\nBoth graphs show an increasing trend over time, supporting an initial visual analysis that the data is getting more spread out. The graph of healthcare spending deviation is particularly linear which drew our interest however we are unsure of how this would implicate our analysis."

    "text": "Data Loading and Cleaning\nThe data comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is supported by the Global Health Data Exchange. The file we chose initially has columns measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. It has 5901 observations. This odd number indicates that there may be some missing observations for certain location/race/year combinations. To load the data, we made an account and downloaded the .csv file called IHME_USA_MMR_STATE_RACE_ETHN_1999_2019_ESTIMATES_Y2023M07D03. We then read it into a dataframe in R. Since the data is already very clean, we simply selected the columns location_id, location_name, race_group, year_id, val, lower, upper to keep in our cleaned dataset and discarded the rest. We chose to discard those columns because every observation had the same value. For example, every observation was Female in the age group 10 to 54. We then saved this cleaned dataframe as a .Rdata file in our repository."

We want to add a map of the US states with fill by MMR, with a slidey bar for changing the year.\nFirst we can add clear, descriptive titles and captions to your graphs to convey their purpose and provide context. Annotations and highlights are crucial for pointing out key insights or significant data points, which can be achieved using geom_text or geom_label in ggplot2, supported by ggpubr. For interactive elements, consider using the plotly or leaflet packages for dynamic features like a sliding bar to explore changes over time. Ensure your color choices are accessible and consistent, and utilize ggpubr to adjust themes, scales, and legends to make the graphs visually appealing and easy to understand.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"dataset/Cleaned_Pregnancy_Data.csv\")\n\nRows: 912 Columns: 30\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): state, notes, versiondate, region\ndbl (26): year, pregnancyratelt15, pregnancyrate1517, pregnancyrate1819, pre...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\naverage_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(MeanAge = mean(average_age_of_pregnancy, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(average_data, aes(x = year, y = MeanAge, color = region, group = region)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of Mean Age of Pregnancy Over Time by Region\",\n       x = \"year\",\n       y = \"Mean Age of Pregnancy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\nGraph 1: This graph displays the trend of the mean age of pregnancy over time, categorized by region. From the graph, we can figure out that: In every region, the mean age of pregnancy has increased over time. This suggests that, on average, women are having children at an older age than they did in the past. The ‘West’ region shows the highest mean age of pregnancy over the entire timeline, starting at around 24 years in the 1970s and rising to just below 30 by the 2010s. The ‘Midwest’ and ‘South’ regions appear to have a similar starting point in the 1970s but diverge slightly over time. The ‘South’ follows closely with the ‘West’, but it still has a lower mean age of pregnancy by the 2010s. The ‘Northeast’ region begins with the lowest mean age of pregnancy but increases at a rate similar to the ‘Midwest’, surpassing it around the mid-2000s.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"dataset/phc_mmr_with_age.csv\")\n\nRows: 1176 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): state, AverageAge, Region\ndbl (3): year, spending, mean_val\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndata$spending &lt;- as.numeric(data$spending)\ndata$AverageAge &lt;- as.numeric(data$AverageAge)\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart with Fitted Lines by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       size = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Region\"))\n\n$colour\n$title\n[1] \"Region\"\n\n$title.position\nNULL\n\n$title.theme\nNULL\n\n$title.hjust\nNULL\n\n$title.vjust\nNULL\n\n$label\n[1] TRUE\n\n$label.position\nNULL\n\n$label.theme\nNULL\n\n$label.hjust\nNULL\n\n$label.vjust\nNULL\n\n$keywidth\nNULL\n\n$keyheight\nNULL\n\n$direction\nNULL\n\n$override.aes\nnamed list()\n\n$nrow\nNULL\n\n$ncol\nNULL\n\n$byrow\n[1] FALSE\n\n$reverse\n[1] FALSE\n\n$order\n[1] 0\n\n$available_aes\n[1] \"any\"\n\n$name\n[1] \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guide\"  \"legend\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"guides\"\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(ggplot(data, aes(x = spending, y = AverageAge, color = Region)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = 3), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, aes(group = Region)) +  \n  scale_size_identity() +  \n  labs(title = \"Healthcare Spending vs. Average Age of Pregnancy by Region\",\n       x = \"Healthcare Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region)) \n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\nRemoved 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph 2: This scatter plot compares healthcare spending with the average age of pregnancy by region. Key observations include: There appears to be a positive correlation between healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy in all regions. This implies that as healthcare spending increases, the average age of pregnancy tends to be higher. The data for the ‘West’ region, shown in purple, indicates a particularly strong positive correlation, suggesting that increased healthcare spending in this region might be closely associated with women having children at older ages. Overall, the graph suggests a trend where regions with higher healthcare spending are associated with older average ages of pregnancy, which could reflect a variety of factors such as access to reproductive health services, birth control, career opportunities, or other socioeconomic factors that allow or encourage women to delay pregnancy.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = AverageAge, y = mean_val, size = spending)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~Region) +\n  labs(title = \"Bubble Chart of Average Age, MMR, and Healthcare Spending\",\n       x = \"Average Age of Pregnancy\",\n       y = \"MMR (per 100,000 live births)\",\n       size = \"Healthcare Spending\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 462 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph 3: This bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the average age of pregnancy, maternal mortality ratio (MMR per 100,000 live births), and healthcare spending by region. The x-axis represents the average age of pregnancy, the y-axis represents the MMR, and the bubble size corresponds to healthcare spending, with larger bubbles indicating higher spending.\nObservations from the chart: - There appears to be a concentration of data points between the ages of 24 and 30, with varying MMR across the regions. - The Midwest, Northeast, and South regions have clusters with a wide range of MMR values but are generally centered around the same average age of pregnancy. - The West region shows a cluster with a lower MMR in comparison to other regions for a similar average age of pregnancy.\nThe chart suggests complexity in the relationship between healthcare spending, the average age of pregnancy, and MMR, and it would likely require a deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors and dynamics.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggmap)\n\nℹ Google's Terms of Service: &lt;https://mapsplatform.google.com&gt;\n  Stadia Maps' Terms of Service: &lt;https://stadiamaps.com/terms-of-service/&gt;\n  OpenStreetMap's Tile Usage Policy: &lt;https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/&gt;\nℹ Please cite ggmap if you use it!

Each colored line on the graph represents a different racial or ethnic category, plotting the mean of ‘val’ for that group against the timeline of ‘year_id’. Several key trends and patterns can be discerned from the graph: - The ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ group exhibits a notable upward trajectory, suggesting a consistent increase in the mean of ‘val’ over the years. Starting from a position close to other groups in the year 2000, there is a significant rise around the year 2010, and by 2020, this group has the highest mean value among all groups shown. - ‘All racial and ethnic groups’ combined show a gradual increase, hinting at an overall rising trend in the mean of ‘val’ across the population. - The ‘Non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander’ group shows an increase, albeit with some fluctuations and a less steep incline compared to the ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ and ‘Non-Hispanic White’ groups.\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year_id, location_name) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(location_name, \"Census\")) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean = mean(val)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = mean)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = location_name))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year_id'.

All regions show an initial increase in the mean value from 2000, with varying rates and fluctuations. Around 2005 to 2008, the Northeast region displays a sharper increase, while the Midwest shows a more gradual rise. Post-2010, all regions experience a significant increase in mean values, with the West and South regions peaking around 2015. The Northeast region exhibits a pronounced peak shortly after 2015, followed by a decline, indicating a possible reversal of the trend or a response to an event or policy change. The trends suggest regional variations in the variable measured, with each region experiencing unique patterns of change over the two decades."

To uphold this principle, one limitation of practicing philanthropy may be the challenge of balancing the need for detailed data to identify differences with the risk of stigmatizing specific communities.\n\n\n\nJustice involves a fair distribution of benefits and burdens. These limitations can be structural barriers to the equitable implementation of interventions, such as systemic racism in the health care system and socioeconomic inequalities that affect health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nload(\"dataset/mmr.RData\")\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = val)) + \n    geom_histogram() + \n    xlim(0, 200)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Each colored line on the graph represents a different racial or ethnic category, plotting the mean of ‘val’ for that group against the timeline of ‘year_id’. Several key trends and patterns can be discerned from the graph: - The ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ group exhibits a notable upward trajectory, suggesting a consistent increase in the mean of ‘val’ over the years. Starting from a position close to other groups in the year 2000, there is a significant rise around the year 2010, and by 2020, this group has the highest mean value among all groups shown. - ‘All racial and ethnic groups’ combined show a gradual increase, hinting at an overall rising trend in the mean of ‘val’ across the population. - The ‘Non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander’ group shows an increase, albeit with some fluctuations and a less steep incline compared to the ‘Non-Hispanic Black’ and ‘Non-Hispanic White’ groups.\n\nmmr_data_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year_id, location_name) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(location_name, \"Census\")) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean = mean(val)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_id, y = mean)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = location_name))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year_id'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph displayed appears to represent the trends in the mean value of MMR over time across four different U.S. Census regions: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West, from the year 2000 to just before 2020. All regions show an initial increase in the mean value from 2000, with varying rates and fluctuations. Around 2005 to 2008, the Northeast region displays a sharper increase, while the Midwest shows a more gradual rise. Post-2010, all regions experience a significant increase in mean values, with the West and South regions peaking around 2015. The Northeast region exhibits a pronounced peak shortly after 2015, followed by a decline, indicating a possible reversal of the trend or a response to an event or policy change. The trends suggest regional variations in the variable measured, with each region experiencing unique patterns of change over the two decades."

The combination of correlation analysis and regression analysis can clarify the relationship and influence of time and demographic categories on average estimates. Principal component analysis (PCA) or multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be performed to simplify data complexity and reveal inherent patterns in low-dimensional Spaces. Clustering can classify similar entities, while time series analysis can highlight time trends and make future predictions. Meanwhile, geospatial analysis can provide insight into regional differences, while sensitivity analysis can assess the reliability of average estimates within their confidence intervals.\nIn addition to these quantitative techniques, we also consider data enrichment strategies including: introducing external socioeconomic variables to deepen the contextual understanding of the estimates.

This set of data contains multiple spreadsheets, however I will focus on the most detailed one. It presents maternal mortality ratios for women in the United States from the ages 10-54 for the years 1999-2019. It divides the data into each state with a national observation, as well as separating into five racial categories. The thirteen columns right as it is downloaded are measure_id, measure_name, location_id, location_name, race_group, sex_id, age_group_id, age_group_name, year_id, metric_id, val, lower, and upper. Some of the columns have the same value for every observation in its raw form and will likely not be relevant to our analysis, like measure_id, measure_name, and age_group_id. Columns like location_name (the name of the state), race_group (the race of the individual), year (the year of the observation), and val (the maternal mortality ratio) will likely be most relevant to our analysis. There are 5901 rows of observations in the data set. The data set is very accessible, simply requiring an account to download. It comes in CSV form. It is quite clean already, however, pivoting the data or making subtables would likely aid in our analysis given its current organization. Some questions we can look at with this data are: “How does maternal mortality change over time? How does maternal mortality vary across US states? How does maternal mortality vary across ethnic groups?” At a deeper level, we could investigate how maternal mortality varies across both state and race groups, and compare with additional data about healthcare for different racial groups to add on a new data set. A possible challenge comes in interpreting the value for the maternal mortality ratio. The value is given along with a lower and upper value, however it is not clear how this number should be interpreted for the analysis. More research is needed here."

The government wants to collect this data to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness. This particular data focuses on the mental health situation during the pandemic. The survey was originally conducted by an internet questionnaire and the sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. The columns of the data include Indicator, group, state, subgroups, phases of treatment, time period of treatment, in which the subgroups label specifies the race, age, and gender of the individuals. The dataset rows first divide the survey takers into separate groups according to the types of treatment and mental health counseling done during the pandemic season.\nThis data is pretty accessible in CSV form. It’s a bit messy with separate subgroups under the column indicator which refer to different types and level of mental health treatment. The main problem that comes across during the data cleaning process is to reevaluate the existing group and split the groups by race, county, and state. I do think the different criteria and the design of the questionnaire make the results messy and less ideal. Some questions we can look at with this data set are: Is there a racial difference across the States of mental health treatment performance during the pandemic? Which part of America is recorded to be the biggest state of mental health care during the quarantine period? A possible challenge we might face is to find a way to filter the data and regenerate an ideal form if data where the subgroups are divided in a logical way."

The challenges we have maybe hard to graph with multi variables such as age. We need to group them in a specific range first and then graph them. In addition, the missing value may affect the outcomes. What’s more, as we have 9 millions data, we are not sure it will need more time to process the data.

In other words, as the average age increases by a year, the predicted maternal mortality in this model increases by 0.0023 percent. This implies that as the average age of mothers increases, MMR tends to increase which also fits with precious simple regression result.\nSpending: The spending coefficient is 0.00000093 (p = 0.015), indicating that each unit increase in healthcare spending is associated with a slight increase in MMR, but the effect is very small. Intuitively, it is generally expected that increasing healthcare spending would reduce maternal mortality rates (MMR). However, since maternal mortality can also be linked to chronic diseases, increased healthcare expenditure does not always directly translate to improved outcomes. Additionally, as individuals are having children later in life compared to previous generations, the probability of maternal mortality may increase, which could contribute to higher healthcare costs without necessarily improving MMR.\n\n&gt; https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/nov/high-costs-maternal-morbidity-need-investment-maternal-health\n\nRegions:\n\nNortheast: This region has a significant negative coefficient of -6.35 (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that, compared to the baseline region, the Northeast is associated with a lower level of MMR.\nOthers: However, the result for other is not statistical significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Linear Regression Model Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\nadj.r.squared\nsigma\nstatistic\np.value\ndf\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n0.0866594\n0.0802093\n11.97426\n13.43527\n0\n6\n-2782.799\n5579.599\n5611.595\n101515\n708\n714\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fit (R-squared and Adjusted R-squared): The R-squared value of 0.087 suggests that the model explains approximately 8.7% of the variability in maternal mortality rates. The adjusted R-squared, at 0.080, adjusts for the number of predictors in the model and shows a similar low explanatory power. This indicates that the predictors included in the model explain only a small portion of the variation in MMR. The process of pregnancy involves everything from social circumstances to self-conditioning, so it makes sense that MMR can be influenced by many more factors. This however represents an increase from the R-squared value of only 3.7% in the previous single regression model.\nModel Significance (F-statistic and p-value): The F-statistic of 13.44 and the associated p-value of 0 show that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning that the relationship between the independent variable and MMR is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\nThe MLR reveals that while the model is statistically significant in predicting maternal mortality rates, as evidenced by the F-statistic and p-value. Meanwhile, other indicators suggest that many additional factors, beyond the predictors used, contribute to variations in maternal mortality. Further research is necessary to identify these influencing factors to improve model accuracy.\n\nModel Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n• The residual plot indicates that the multiple linear regression model generally fits the data well, as evidenced by the mostly random scatter of residuals around zero.\n• However, the presence of slight curvature suggests potential non-linearity in the relationship, and the mild fan shape of the residuals suggests possible heteroscedasticity, meaning that the variability in MMR may increase with higher fitted values. The presence of outliers also suggests that further investigation is needed to ensure these points do not disproportionately influence the model’s results.\n\n\n\n\n\n• The normal Q-Q plot shows that the residuals of the model generally follow a normal distribution, as most data points align with the diagonal reference line.\n• However, there are notable deviations at the tails, particularly at the upper end, indicating the presence of significant outliers and suggesting that the residuals are not perfectly normal. This lack of normality at the extremes suggests that certain extreme data points might be influencing the model, potentially affecting its assumptions and necessitating further investigation or alternative modeling approaches."

Additionally, the available data on pregnancy rates across various states lacks comprehensive categorization by ethnic groups, thereby hindering a more refined analysis that could reveal differential effects of pregnancy rates among distinct ethnic demographics on maternal mortality rates.\nThe healthcare spending data did not account for variations in the inflation rate over the years. This oversight could result in a misleading upward trend in healthcare expenditure over time, potentially compromising the validity of subsequent analyses and conclusions derived from this data. It is therefore recommended that future studies adjust for inflation to provide a more accurate depiction of real changes in healthcare spending, ensuring a more reliable investigation into its effects on maternal mortality rates."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nTemporal Trends in Maternal Mortality: Observational data indicates a progressive increase in maternal mortality rates across the United States over time. Particularly vulnerable to this trend are Non-Hispanic American Indian, Alaska Native, and Non-Hispanic Black populations, which exhibit disproportionately higher rates of maternal mortality.\nHealthcare Spending Distribution: Analyses reveal that the allocation of healthcare spending is relatively consistent across various U.S. regions. This uniformity suggests that regional disparities in maternal outcomes may be influenced by factors other than the mere level of financial investment in healthcare.\nImpact of Healthcare Expenditure on Maternal Mortality: There is a prevailing assumption that increasing healthcare spending will lead to a reduction in maternal mortality rates. However, the data suggests a complex relationship that may require a multifaceted approach, addressing quality and accessibility of maternal care, alongside increased financial investment.\nCorrelation Between Maternal Age and Mortality Rates: Evidence points to a correlation between the age of pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, with an increase in age associated with higher mortality risks. This trend underscores the need for enhanced prenatal and postnatal care tailored to older pregnant women, highlighting age as a significant factor in maternal health risk assessments."

    "text": "More people are dying giving birth over last few decades, even with better medical equipment…?\nWhile one may have expected maternal mortality to have decreased in the last two decades due to innovations in and better access to natal care, the opposite is true. The original goal of this team was to investigate how healthcare policy and economic factors contributed to maternal mortality. However, once this increasing death rate trend was uncovered, the team pivoted to looking at other environmental factors such as location, spending, and age to hopefully shed some light on this scary trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this investigation into MMR matter?\nThe maternal mortality rate gives insight into the trends and disparities of public health resources, how healthcare policy is formed and informed, and overall societal welfare in the United States. This research matters not only because it reflects the effectiveness of the healthcare system, but the increasing tendency also highlight the broader socioeconomic causes of outcome disparities behind the scenes.\n\n\nInteractive Maps\nHere is the trend of MMR and Healthcare Spending for each state from 1999 to 2019:\nMaternal Mortality Interactive Map\nHealth Care Spending Interactive Map\n\n\nYoung Woman - Rich Woman?\nIn the exploration of the possible environmental factors to cause this increase in mortality, the scholarly articles that examine the same data gave us the idea to take a close look at the healthcare spending and the average age of pregnancy. The data we found for these variables display these trends: 1. People are having babies later and later in life. 2. People are spending more and more on healthcare. We predict that the maternal mortality ratios will be lower in groups with lower age of pregnancy and higher spending on healthcare. So, being a rich and young woman should be the solution to this emerging problem – but is it?\n\n\n\nThesis statement\nThe increase in the maternal mortality rate is significantly influenced by a combination of environmental factors such as spending on healthcare and the average age of pregnancy.\n\n\nThoughts from Findings\n\nYounger Age is Preferred, but …\nExisting biology research into best habits and behaviors for pregnancy indicates that there does not seem to be a “golden year of giving birth” However, the statistical results show that the average age of pregnancy is a strong predictor of the MMR trend. This trend supports the idea that the growing average age is contributing to the increasing maternal mortality rate across the country. While MMR is also a result of chronic illness and other disease that leads to fatal situations, it is important to consider that the increasing age leads to these higher risk scenarios and this contributes to mortality overall.\nHere are two links to relevant bio-medical research:\n\nArticle on Causes of Maternal Mortality in the United States\nArticle on Disease duing Pregancy\n\n\n\nSpending needs a second thought…\nIn the analysis of healthcare spending, the data shows a moderate link between spending and maternal mortality rates.\nEach point in the graph below represents the average MMR and average healthcare spending from 1999 to 2019 for each state. The blue fitted line shows a negative trend that increasing healthcare spending will reduce the MMR.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are couple outliers in the graph which reduce the accuracy of the fitted line. There maybe other factors that can affect MMR.\n\n\n\nFuture Action\nDespite the advances in medical technology and healthcare practices, the maternal mortality rate unexpectedly has grown in the recent decades. The sharp increase of MMR in all race groups and regional groups reveal the crucial fact that the resource allocation and socioeconomic factors are drastically influencing the data performance.\nBy understanding the complex potential causes, the research underscores the need for comprehensive strategies addressing broader determinants of health, economic resources, and healthcare practices to reverse this troubling trend in maternal mortality."

This suggests that in most regions, the average age at which women are pregnant falls within this bracket. The histogram also shows that as the average age of pregnancy increases, fewer regions report these higher ages, with the 28 to 29 age range being less common and below 25 being the least common. This data can be valuable for designing region-specific healthcare policies and programs that address the reproductive health needs of women according to their predominant age groups."
